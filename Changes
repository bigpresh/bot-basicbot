0.60 2005/03/21
  - Charset support

  - Fixed stupid bug where the return value of said wasn't getting said.
    How can I not have noticed?
  - if you don't return true from init, be more helpful.
  - if help doesn't return true, don't say anything
  - Made SYNOPSIS clearer

0.30 2003/01/02
  - Randomized name so you can run more than one at once in one POE session
