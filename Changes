    Useful when implementing bots.

0.83  Fri Nov 5 12:40:00 CET 2010
  - Applied patch from Mario DomgÃ¶rgen to use log() for warnings (RT #51804)
  - Only ignore said() when it returns undef/empty list, not false
  - got_names was never getting called. Fixed that.

0.82  Wed Nov 3 02:09:36 GMT 2010
  - Maintainership moved from cpan:TOMI to cpan:HINRIK

  - Migrate distribution to Dist::Zilla
  - Eliminate bogus "NAMES HASH(0x1234567)" queries the bot was making after
    joining a channel

0.81 2009/01/26
  - Implement remove_from_all_channels, you idiot. Sigh.

0.80 2009/01/22
  - Understand quit messages - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=42625
  - Fix the ->name method on the bot to actually return something sensible - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=27427

  - Added raw_nick support and a tiny amount of documentation
  - Support for SSL, contributed by Bradley M. Kuhn <bkuhn@softwarefreedom.org>

0.61 2005/05/13
  - Fix for the odd behaviour of freenode - we ask the server for the time
    periodically to catch servers that don't send pings.

0.60 2005/03/21
  - Charset support
  - use Text::Wrap to split up really long responses, instead of a
    nasty regexp, so we split on spaces properly.

  - Real (almost) tests

  - Fixed 'addressing' typo, thanks Earle
  - Fixed annoying errors for logging
  - Fixed stupid bug where the return value of said wasn't getting said.
    How can I not have noticed?
  - if you don't return true from init, be more helpful.
  - if help doesn't return true, don't say anything
  - Made SYNOPSIS clearer

0.30 2003/01/02
  - Randomized name so you can run more than one at once in one POE session
  - Log a lot less.
  - Be more aggressive about reconnecting to the server
  - Put reconnect stand-offs into a lot more places, so we get less confused.
